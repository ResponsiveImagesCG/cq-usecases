# Web Platform Incubator Community Group

This repository is being used for work in the W3C Web Platform Incubator
Community Group, governed by the [W3C Community License Agreement
(CLA)](http://www.w3.org/community/about/agreements/cla/). To make substantive
contributions, you must join the WICG.

Instructions for joining W3C community groups are
[here](https://www.w3.org/community/about/faq/#how-do-i-join-a-group);
TL;DR, you need to [create a W3C account](https://www.w3.org/accounts/request)
and then click the “join or leave this group” button on the
[WICG’s page](https://www.w3.org/community/wicg/).

If you are not the sole contributor to a contribution (pull request), please
identify all contributors in the pull request comment.

To add a contributor (other than yourself, that's automatic), mark them one per
line as follows:

```
+@github_username
```

If you added a contributor by mistake, you can remove them in a comment with:

```
-@github_username
```

If you are making a pull request on behalf of someone else but you had no part
in designing the feature, you can remove yourself with the above syntax.

This spec is written using [Bikeshed](http://github.com/tabatkins/bikeshed).
For configuration options, etc. please see the
[Bikeshed docs](http://github.com/tabatkins/bikeshed).
